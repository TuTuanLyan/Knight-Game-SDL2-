# Knight's Challenge Game:

  My first SDL2 game C++ project in UET-VNU on 15/4/2024.

  In Knight's Challenge Game, you'll step into the role of a knight, but instead of riding a horse or wielding a sword, you'll be armed with a modern gun to fend off hordes of monsters and emerge victorious. Aim    to eliminate all the monsters and claim victory! Good luck!

# Instructions for installing Knight Game:
  
  Since I developed this game on Windows, I currently only have installation instructions for windows
  You can see how to install on other operating systems here [Lazy Foo Setup SDL2 tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php)
  Sorry for the inconvenience!

  To start installing and running the game you need to download Visual Studio or any IDE that can run C++.
  On my git download the zip file named SDL2VS.zip.
  Extract the SDL2VS.zip file anywhere you want on your device.

  Next, search the toolbar on your device for the keyword "edit environment variables for your account".
  Click and then navigate to path. Select Edit -> New -> Browse.
  Then, select the address of the SDL2VS folder you just extracted, select SDL2-2.30.0 -> lib -> x64.
  Repeat the above steps with the remaining image mixxer and tff folders

  Image:\SDL2_image-2.8.2\lib\x64
  
  Mixxer:\SDL2_mixer-2.8.0\lib\x64
  
  TFF:\SDL2_ttf-2.22.0\lib\x64

  Next, open the Game_2D_SDL2 folder with VS or any IDE you want then launch with Debug/x64

  Now you can play my game on your personal device.

  Hope you have fun playing my game! Thanks :3

  Note: My instructions are for Window 64bit devices.

# Here's a guide on how to play Knight Game:
  "Use the left and right arrow keys to move left or right as desired.

  Use the up arrow key to jump.

  Press the left mouse button to shoot.

  Please note that each press will only fire one bullet, and I haven't set up a continuous shooting mode.

  Always keep an eye on your remaining health in the top left corner of the screen. The game will end when you run out of health.

  Of course, if you fall into a pit, the game will also end.

  Each time you defeat a monster, you will earn 1 point. Keep track of your score in the top right corner of the screen.

  Wishing you a great gaming experience!

  Thank you! :3"
